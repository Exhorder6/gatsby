## Move from Gnome to Xfce

The most noteworthy aspect of the 2019.4 release is Kali’s move from the Gnome environment to Xfce to address some known issues. Specific improvements as a result of the new environment include:

### \#1 Improved performance

The Gnome environment is a fully-featured desktop environment with many capabilities. However all the capabilities come with overhead that is often not useful for a distribution like Kali. Moving to the more lightweight Xfce environment addresses these issues, providing an environment more in line with the typical Kali user’s needs.

### \#2 Unified UI

Because Kali can be run on everything from bare metal to high end laptops, the lower-end ARM builds often had a different UI than other deployments. OffSec now offers a standardized UI for all Kali distributions.

### \#3 Kali Undercover

Let’s say you are working in a public place and you might not want the distinctive Kali dragon for everyone to see and wonder what it is you are doing.

The developers made a little script that will change your Kali theme to look like a default Windows installation. That way, you can work a bit more incognito. After you are done and in a more private place, run the script again and you switch back to your Kali theme.

### Other Kali Linux 2019.4 updates

* Kali Documentation has a new home and is now Git powered
* Public Packaging – getting your tools into Kali
* Kali NetHunter KeX – Full Kali desktop on Android
* BTRFS during setup
* Added PowerShell
* The kernel is upgraded to version 5.3.9
* Plus the normal bugs fixes and updates.

## My final thought

Bye, Gnome, Hi, Xfce… The latest iteration swaps Gnome for Xfce as its main desktop environment, although users can keep a slightly tweaked Gnome build if they want. But as the Kali Linux team put it in a blog today: 

> “Gnome has been overkill for most Kali users, as many just want a window manager that allows you to run multiple terminal windows at once, and a web browser.”
