Nehalem is feature-rich; many things like SEO, search functionality or optimization for all devices (mobile, tablet and desktop) are already 
implemented. Let's take a look at all features available:

## Dynamic navigation

The two navigations (main at the top, footer) can be customized by simply editing the `menu` and `footerMenu` properties within the 
`gatsby-config.js`. 

## Search

Another out-of-the-box feature is the search functionality which is based 
on [gatsby-plugin-lunr](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-lunr/).
